_Problems adapted from the PSDS textbook_

## Calling built-in functions

Create a variable `my_name` that contains your name

```{r}
my_name <- "Akilah Dixon"
```


Create a variable `name_length` that holds how many letters (including spaces) are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)

```{r}
name_length <- nchar (my_name)
```



Print the number of letters in your name

```{r}
paste(name_length)
```

Create a variable `now_doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" (use the `paste()` function)

```{r}
now_doing <- paste(my_name, "is programming")
```

Make the `now_doing` variable upper case

```{r}
toupper (now_doing)
```


## Operations with Numbers

Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`

```{r}
fav_1 <- 22
fav_2 <- 95

```


Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the original variable

```{r}
fav_1 <- fav_1/ sqrt (201)
fav_2 <- fav_2/ sqrt (201)

```


Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the `sum()` function for practice.

```{r}
raw_sum <- sum(fav_1,fav_2)
```


Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 1 decimal place. Use the `round()` function.

```{r}
round_sum <- round(raw_sum, 1)
```


Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and `fav_2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places

```{r}
round_1 <- round(fav_1,1)
round_2 <- round(fav_2,1)
```

Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values

```{r}
sum_round <- sum(round_1,round_2)
```


Which is bigger, `round_sum` or `sum_round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)

```{r}
max(sum_round, round_sum)
```


## Functions and Conditionals

Define a function `is_twice_as_long` that takes in two character strings, and returns whether or not (e.g., a boolean) the length of one argument is greater than or equal to twice the length of the other.
_Hint_: compare the length difference to the length of the smaller string


```{r}
is_twice_as_long <- function(str1, str2){
  diff <- abs(nchar(str1)-nchar(str2))
  min_length <- min(nchar(str1),nchar(str2))
  diff >= min_length #if difference is more than
}



```

Call your `is_twice_as_long` function by passing it different length strings to confirm that it works. Make sure to check when _either_ argument is twice
as long, as well as when neither are!

```{r}
is_twice_as_long("Hello","hi")

```

Define a function `describe_difference` that takes in two strings. The function should return one of the following sentences as appropriate 

- "Your first string is longer by N characters"

- "Your second string is longer by N characters"

- "Your strings are the same length!"

```{r}
describe_difference <- function(first,second){
  diff <- nchar(first) - nchar(second)
  if(diff > 0){
    sentence <- paste("Your first string is longer by", diff, "characters")
  }else if(diff < 0){
    sentence <- paste("Your second string is longer by", -diff, "characters")
  }else{
    sentence <- paste("your strings are the same length!")
  }
  sentence
}
  



```



Call your `describe_difference` function by passing it different length strings to confirm that it works. Make sure to check all 3 conditions

```{r}
describe_difference("Hello", "Hi")
describe_difference("Hi", "Hello")
describe_difference("Hi", "Hi")
```
